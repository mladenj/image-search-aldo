# image-search-demo
Semantic image search uses a text query or an input image to search a database of images to find images that are semantically similar to the search query. Thanks to advances in machine learning and computer vision, we can better understand what a user is looking for when they search for an image. It's completely independent from all text from the website (categorisation, alt tags, description etc.).
